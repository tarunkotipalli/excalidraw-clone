# Excalidraw Clone Project 

## Objective
The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Excalidraw website within a span of three weeks.

## UI Reference
For design and functionality inspiration, we will be using the [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) as a reference.

## Project Status
This project is currently under development and is a work in progress [Excalidraw](https://sandeep-mz.github.io/Excalidraw-clone/) . Tasks are scheduled to be completed within a three-week timeframe, with weekly updates on our progress. Please check back regularly for the latest updates and contributions.

## Components
The Excalidraw User Interface (UI) can conveniently be divided into different sections to create a clone. Here's a list of the various sections we will consider when breaking down the entire clone into components:

1. **Freehand Drawing**: Implement the core drawing functionality that allows users to create freehand sketches.

2. **Coloring and Styling**: Add tools and options for users to select colors and style their drawings.

3. **Selection and Transformation**: Implement the ability to select and transform drawn elements.

4. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Provide users with the ability to undo and redo actions.

5. **Saving and Loading Sketches**: Enable users to save their sketches and load them at a later time.
